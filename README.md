# PHD lecture of bayesian filtering and smoothing
This repository should show content of lectures I have taken. Its called "Non-linear filtering", but its focusing on bayesian filtering and smooting.
My sources were: 

Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing: https://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/30657/excerpt/9781107030657_excerpt.pdf
Control Systems and Control Engineering Tutorials: https://aleksandarhaber.com/control-systems-tutorials/
Data Fusion with Linear Kalman Filter : https://www.udemy.com/course/data-fusion-with-linear-kalman-filter

I intended to go through each step, manualy derive equations and implement them using python. No libraries, all done manualy.
